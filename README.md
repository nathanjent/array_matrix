# Array Matrix
A Rust library to generate a matrix struct from an array. All the typical matrix methods will be implemented by a macro.

This is my first attempt at writing a useful macro in Rust. I am borrowing many of the matrix features from this crate [generic-matrix](https://crates.io/crates/generic-matrix)
